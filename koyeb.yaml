Koyeb Configuration
This file is optional - Koyeb will auto-detect Laravel/PHP
You can also configure everything through the Koyeb web interface

For Laravel, Koyeb uses Heroku PHP buildpack which automatically:
- Detects PHP and installs dependencies via composer
- Detects Node.js and builds assets if package.json exists
- Configures Apache to serve from public/ directory

The Procfile specifies: web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/

Environment variables should be set in Koyeb dashboard:
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_KEY=base64:...
APP_URL=https://mysterious-eleonora-minhajt-8556aa8e.koyeb.app/
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
LOG_LEVEL=error
